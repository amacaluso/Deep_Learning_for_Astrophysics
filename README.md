# Machine-Learning-in-Astrophysics
This project contains the code to perform a task of Particle identification (PID) in Astrophysics, comparing Deep Learning and Classical Machine Learning approaches.
Data are provided by Agile team (http://agile.rm.iasf.cnr.it/) and the goal of the analysis is to provide a Statistical model which is able to distinguish gamma-ray photon for background particles.
